      The image above is the founder of our company: Cameron Winters. Cameron was introduced to video games when, at a very young age, he caught a glimpse of 
      his uncle doing something with the TV as he was following his grandmother around her house. He got a closer look and had his first look and experience of 
      a video game. Since that moment, Cameron began to enjoy video games whether that be at home or arcade games. He even began to start coding his own game that 
      would soon become known as <i>Personalities</i>. It would go on to become a major success and would be the game to jumpstart his carreer and create <i>Pixel Rush Games</i>. 
      Cameron's friends would come along and help out later on. From there, the company would expand and become another competitor in the video game industry.

    <h2 class="title">Current News</h2>
    <h3 class="title">Last Updated 3/01/24</h3>
    <p class="textInfoAreaTwo">
      We have major future plans for the overall advancement of our company. First off we have been working on a few new titles that we hope will bring excitement to 
      everyone who plays them. One of these is a first-person horror game called <i>Faded Memories</i>. After losing your way in the woods while on a camping trip, 
      you come across an abandoned town that lays in ruin from some sort of disaster. As you explore, you will uncover the secrests of the people who once inhabited 
      the town and what exactly happened to them. Be aware though, even though the town seems abandoned, you are not alone! The picture above is an early screenshot of 
      the game and is expected to be released this October. 
    </p>
    <p class="bioTextInfoArea">
      As for other plans, we are working on various other titles such as the third instalment in the <i>Personalities</i> series where we will be attempting to bring the 
      series into the world of 3D while still keping it's original charm. We have also began development on a new title called <i>Explorer</i>: an open-world game where 
      you can build your own structures and explore various environments ranging from a mountainous forest to a extensive ocean. An early screenshot can be sen below on the left. Finally, we have begun brainstorming for 
      an action-shooter game taking inspiration from <i>Fortnite</i> and <i>Splatoon</i>. We will share more details as we make developments on these projects.
       We are also working out deals with other companies to create licensed merchandise for some of our IPs. Our plan is to launch 
      with merchandise from the <i>Personalities</i> series with figurines, clothing, and other miscellaneous merchandise. Check 
      this website weekly for any new updates.
